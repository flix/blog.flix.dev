> **"Every lie we tell incurs a debt to the truth. Sooner or later, that debt is paid."**

â€” Valery Legasov (*Jared Harris, Chernobyl 2019*)

Add some quotes from HackerNews

In this blog post, Lifting the veil from a PL designers point of view.

What we expect from a type system

What we expect from an effect system

The first lie:

```flix

```

We can use it 


```flix
...

```

The problem with lies is not the lie itself, it is its consequences.

The optimizer wrecks havoc

Fixing it with more lies:

```
intrododucing a local variable
```


```
forcing the argument to pass through
```


# A better solution, flix style




## Getting source and line offset

- THe debug pseudo macro, and how broken it is...


## Other Lies

Everything is printable

Getting the loc and offset is pure
